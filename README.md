# Fix holes and customize the map (Updated to The Criminal Enterprises DLC)

The purpose of this script is to fix the holes in the map by loading zones that arenâ€™t loaded by default.

This fork by TayMcKenzieNZ is to work alongside my fork of [online-interiors](https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/online-interiors) which adds teleporters to and from the locations for on foot and vehicles.

## [Wiki](https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl/wiki)
- The Wiki has been created to help you customize your interiors as you wish. I have gone ahead and customised them for you however if you do not like how it is done, you can set it up the way you like using bob's wiki. It contains every function you can use for each interior.

- Each Wiki page has an example at the bottom of the page to show how you can use it in your own resource.

- Also at the bottom of the Wiki will show you the default values set by `IPL_NAME.LoadDefault()`.

## Install
1. Download my fork of bob74_ipl
2. Extract `bob74_ipl.zip` and copy the `bob74_ipl` into your `resources` folder.

3. add `start bob74_ipl` and `start online-interiors` to your `server.cfg`
